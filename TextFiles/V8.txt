Chrome V8 Engine
The code that we write cannot be understood by the computer, for that we need what is called a JS Engine.
A Js Engine is a program that converts Js code to machine code that the computers can understand and work with.
So, in simple terms a Js Engine can execute Js codes.
Javascript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors.
    - V8 -> Chrome(2008)
    - Spider Monkey -> Mozila
    - JavascriptCore -> Safari
    - Chakra -> Edge

See v8 docs
 - Accroding to them, we can embed V8 in our own C++ application, by doing so we can add new features to Javascript
 - Now as C++ is great for Low Level Operation such a file handling, database connectios and network operations by embedding V8 into C++, you get those superpowers into Javascript
 - Now here the C++ program that we are talking about is called NODEJS
