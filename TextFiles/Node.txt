Node(2009) is an open source, cross platform Javascript runtime environment
 
After the release of NODEJS in 2009, now we can run JS code outside the browser
to build
    - Traditional websites
    - Backend services like APIS
    - Real-time applications
    - Streaming services
    - CLI 
    etc....
Node js allows us to build complex and powerfull applications
See github node src code
    - Deps folder
    - Src folder
    - Lib folder

Unlink browser's runtime nodejs dosen't have access to any web api list so there is no WINDOW or DOCUMENT in node js
