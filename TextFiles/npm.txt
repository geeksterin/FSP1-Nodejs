npm = node package manager
package.json
    - It is npm's config file.
    - It is a json file that typically lives in the root directory of your package and holds various metadata relevant to the package.
    - This file is the central place to config and describe how to interact and run your package
    - Create your own package.json, and explain all fileds in detail, two maindetory feilds are name,version
    {
        "name": name-of-package,
        "version":sem-ver(major.minor.patch),
        "description":this desc will be used to describe packages in npm registry,
        "keywords":[k1,k2,k3... keywords helps packages fast],
        "main":entry point to project,
        "scripts":{
            "script-name":"script",
        },
        "bin":{
            "cmd":"entry point"
        }
        ,
        "author":"author-name",
        "license":"ISC",
        "dependencies":{
            name:version
        }
    }

    - We don't have to create this file manually , we use the npm cli to do, using the npm init or npm init -y cmd.
    to install a package =  npm install/i packageName
    to install a package of particuler version = npm i packageName@version
    to install all the dependencies at once simply use npm install
Global package
    - to install any package globallu we use the sudo(mac) npm install -g packname cmd /sudo(mac) npm uninstall -g packname .
-Npm scripts
    - An npm script is a convenient way to bundle common commands for use in a project.
    - They are typically entered in the command line in order to do something with the apllication
    - Npm scripts are stored in a project's json file, giving access to everyone who has access to the codebase.
    - They also ensures that everyone is using the same cmds with same options.
    - common use cases would starting dev server "start":"node entry.js" or to star testing "test":"jest",
    - Npm scripts are executed using the command npm run "script-name"
Publising to npm registry
    - create a accout on https://www.npmjs.com/
    - npm adduser <username>
    - npm publish
    - https://npmjs.com/package/<package-name>
-Shabang, pass on arg on cli
    - #!/usr/bin/env node (this think is known as shabang or hashbang, it basically tells os which interpreter to use and location of that)
    - add the script name to "bin" option in package.json
    - now install this package globally, using sudo npm install -g
    - process.argv = to take input from cli
