In JS function and Classes are first class citizens,
it means a function or class can be passed as an argument to a functions,
as well can be returned from a function.
write some example
A function that is passed as an argument to another function is known as a callback function.
The function that accepts the callback or return a function from insdie known as higher order function.

Callbacks are two types
    - Synchronous callbacks - A callback which is executed immidiatly.(map,filter,sort etc)
    - Asynchronous callbacks - A callback that is ofter used to resume code execution after an aync operation has completed.
    - So in async js , callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particuler time ot event has occurred.
    - This nature is important as in node have an aync nature to prevent blocking
    - ex - feteching data etc...
