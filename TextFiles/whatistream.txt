- A stream is sequence of data that is being moved from one point to anotheR point over time.
- ex -> stream of water
- Process streams of data in chunks as they arrive insted of waiting for the entire data to be avalible before processing.
- ex- watching videos on youtube.
- using buffers streams are abale to bring data from one point to another.

- NodeJs in its core heavily uses Streams(ex fs module)
- There are four fundamemtal types of stream
        - i) Writable => Stream in which data can be written.(fs.createWriteStream());
        - ii) Readable => Stream from which data can be read.(fs.createReadStream());
        - iii) Duplex => Streams that are both readable and writtable.
        - iv) Transform => can modify data while reading or writing
- Strems also implememt nodejs events module.
show some example using the fs module.
Pipe
    - Pipe is a way for connecting multiple streams together.
    - leftStream.pipe(rightStream) = leftStream(readableStream),rightStream(writable,Duplex,Transform)
Custom stream
    - {Readable,Writable,Transform} = require("stream")
Readable
    const readableStream = new Readable({
        read(size) {},
    });
Writable
    const writableStream = new Writable({
        write(chunk) {
        console.log("i am in writableStream");
        console.log(chunk.toString());
        },
    });
  
Transform
    const transFormStream = new Transform({
        transform(chunk, encoding, cb) {
        const modifiedData = chunk.toString().replace("Lorem", "Samiul");
        cb(null, modifiedData);
        },
    });
