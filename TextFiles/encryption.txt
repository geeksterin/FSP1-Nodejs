Encryption is a way of translating data from plaintext (unencrypted) to ciphertext (encrypted).
Encryption is one way, that is you can encrypt data but cannot decrypt the already encrypted data.

when encrypting = Data -> Data+salt(key) -> Encrypt using various algorithm(sha512,sha256) -> Encryption(store this encryption)
when checking wheather the provided data is correct or false

Data -> Data+salt(key) -> Encrypt using various algorithm(sha512,sha256) -> compare this encryption with already stored Encryption, if both are same than data is same.


How strong your encryption will be depends upon how strong your salt(key) is.
To create strong salt(key) you can use the nodejs inbuilt Crypto module, that deals entrily in encryption of data.
crypto.randomBytes(bytes).toString("hex"); will create a randomBytes string of size=bytes in hex format.


Now whenever a user would like to signup,they at minimum would provide their {name,email,password};
Now in database we will store {name,email,encrypted(password)};
Now when signin we will compare their password with the stored password.


[srcaddress,destaddess]["hi, i am iron man"] = "ewwijguwegewutuwiernsdbjshfjhs" = [srcaddress,destaddess]["hi, i am iron man"]

1) [srcaddress,destaddess]["hi, i am iron man"] + salt(key)
2) Encryption will happen
3) Encryption will be decypted using the same salt(key);
