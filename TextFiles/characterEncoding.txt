- Character encoding define how a number in a charcater set as a binary data before in can be stored in a computer.
- It dictates how many bits to ue to represent the number.
- example = utf-8
- Utf-8 states that charater should be encoded in bytes(8bits)
- 4 = 100 = 00000100
- "s" = 1110011 = 01110011
- similer guidlines also exits on how images and videos should be encoded and stored in binary format such as base64
see img(binary_data);
