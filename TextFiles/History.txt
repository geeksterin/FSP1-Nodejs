History about ECMASCRIPT

Creating of Javascript
    - In 1993 first web browser with a user interface called MOSAIC was released
    - In 1994 the founders of MOSAIC founded a company called NETSCAPE and created a more polished browser called NETSCAPE NEVIGATOR
    - Although NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR got the popularity but it lacked the dynamic capabilities ,web pages was only static with no interactivity
    -  To address this NETSCAPE created a new scriping language called Javascript
    - Interestingly the name purely was a marketing gimic as JAVA was a popular lan.
Microsoft
    - In 1995 Microsoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer , war begun with Netscape
    - But Microsoft realished that how Javascript changed the user experience and wanted the same for IE
    - But there was no specification for them to follow
    - so , in 1996 by reverse engineering of already in service navigator interpreter of Javascript , they created a new scripting langiage called JScript
    - The differences made the developers life hard , as now they had to develope for both the browsers individually.

Resolve
    - to resolve the problem Netscape submitted Javascript to ECMA international
    - ECMA is an industry association dedicated to the standarlization of information and communication system
    - Netscape wanted a standard specification to which all browser vendors will agree
    - For each new specification ECMA provides a standard specification and a commitee
    - In case of Javascript , the standard is ECMA-262 and the commitee that works on ECMA-262 is called TC39
    - ECMA implemented the standards , and created a language called ECAMScript
    - Todays Javascript is build on top of Ecmascript

    - 1997 Ecmascript 1
    - 1998 Ecmascript 2
    - 1999 Ecmascript 3
    - Ecmascript 4 never released
    - 2009 Ecmascript 5
    - 2015 Ecmascript 2015(ES6) , this one provides modern JS features
    - and a new version every year since 2015

Though Ecmascript and Javascript technically not same, but the two words are used interchangeably

Summary
    - ECMA-262 is the language specification
    - ECMAScript is a langauage that implements ECAM-262
    - Javacript is basically Ecmascript at its core
